# StashSphere - Social Inventory

## Overview

stashsphere allows you to create an inventory of your tools, supplies
and materials.

All these **things** can be added to one or many **lists**. **Things** and **Lists**
can then be shared with other **users** on the same instance in defined levels
of exposure, from completely *private* to *friends of friends*.

stashsphere is free and open source software, built to protect your
privacy and ready to self-host.

## Philosophy

In modern life, we rely on a wide variety of tools and materials to create, repair,
garden, and cook.
These range from basic consumables like screws, bolts, and nuts to more specialized
equipment such as cameras, computer hardware, cables, and adapters.
Over time these things accumulate and most of them are only used occasionally.
Buying them is easy as especially online shops and dedicated search engines
help us all the way until they are delivered to our homes.
The same is true for DIY-stores where a neat order is maintained so that we
can find the right screws, nuts and tools for the job.
However, once an item arrives at our home, it enters a world of personal order
and usually vanishes from public life.
We may be able to share an item with a friend once in a while, but it's often
difficult to establish this process in a consistent or meaningful way.
Stashsphere is here to help make that process easier—by giving you a smart,
organized, and shareable space for everything you and your friends own.

*Think of it as an online shop that contains all the things you and your
friends are willing to share with each other.*

The assumption is that friends actually know and trust each other to a
certain extend. Hence no messaging system is implemented as you and your friends
surely are already in touch.
