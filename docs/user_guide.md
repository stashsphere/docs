# User Guide

## Your Account

StashSphere is built around user accounts and profiles. All things you add are connected
to your account. As you are the owner, only you can edit and delete them.

## Levels of Visibility

Each thing you add is private by default. That means only you can see it.
You can share things within a range of visibility for others:

* directly with another user, only this user will be able to access the thing
* with all friends, shared with all users that are listed as friends
* with all friends and their friends, this is the most public setting

## Lists and Things

Each thing can be part of many lists. You can share lists just like things.

## Images

StashSphere does not assume that you and your friends all know the exact term
for each thing. But probably you know at least how the thing looks like.
That is why images play a key role in how StashSphere works.

You can upload images independently of things to make the process of adding things
in bulk as easy as possible.
This allows you to upload images you made with your smartphone directly and, later
on a device with a bigger screen, add the corresponding thing entries.
